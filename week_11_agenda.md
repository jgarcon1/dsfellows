# Brainstorm: what could you do with your domain?

# Reclaim basics

To edit your site, go to [https://reclaimhosting.com/](https://reclaimhosting.com/). Click Client Area Login and enter your login details.

Click on cPanel (in the menu bar along the top). This is your control panel, which will let you manage applications and edit/add files to the site.

Click File Manager in the menu bar.

The public_html folder contains the files that generate the "front end" or visible part of your site. This is the folder you'll be working with when you edit your site.

public_html/img stores the images for your site. Try adding an image. Can you figure out where that image appears on your site/what URL you need to use to find it?

What's in the CSS and JS folders? Can you figure out how to view these files on your website?

You can also use various applications to build/design your site for you instead of coding it yourself (for example, Wordpress or Omeka). Go back to your cPanel and click All Applications. Scroll through the options. Try installing one. What happens (in the file manager, and to the 'front end' of your site)?

# The future

Your Reclaim account will expire in a year. If you want to keep your site, you'll have the option to either renew it for $30/year or transfer your site to a free hosting service.

[To move a Wordpress site hosted on Reclaim to a free Wordpress URL, see these instructions.](https://en.support.wordpress.com/moving-from-self-hosted-wordpress-to-wordpress-com/)

[To create a backup of your Reclaim site (which will give you a copy of your files that you can use to transfer your site to a different domain), see these instructions.](https://community.reclaimhosting.com/t/generating-a-backup/293)

You might consider moving your site to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which will host it for free at yourusername.github.io. Example: this [Early Novels Database website](https://earlynovels.github.io/), created using Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages.

# Exercise

Choose a theme for your site from Wordpress or [html5up](https://html5up.net/). Try customizing menus, text, images, etc.

OR:

Create a simple landing page for your site using HTML and CSS.

OR:

Continue work on a Jekyll site that you'll be able to host on your Github (or potentially your Reclaim site!)

# Addendum: uploading an html5up theme to your Reclaim site

Reclaim's file manager is set up to only let you upload a single file at a time - frustrating if you want to use a complicated, multi-file html5up (or similar) theme on your site! One way around this is to use FTP (file transfer protocol - [see instructions here](https://community.reclaimhosting.com/t/ftp-file-transfer-protocol/304)). But if you don't want to set that up, here's a shortcut:

+ Create a zip file of the folder containing your edited html5up theme by selecting the folder (NOT the files inside) and compressing it.

![Compressing a folder](/html5up-images/html5up-0.png)

+ Open the Reclaim file manager. Open the public_html folder, then click Upload (in the gray menu bar). A page that looks like this will pop up. Upload your zip folder, making sure you're placing it in the public_html folder.

![Uploading a zip file](/html5up-images/html5up-1.png)

+ Click on public_html and find your zip file in the list of files inside the directory. Click the zip file to highlight it, then click Extract (in the upper left-hand corner) to unzip it. A window that looks like this should pop up. Make sure it's set up to extract the files to /public_html and click Extract File(s).

![Extracting files](/html5up-images/html5up-2.png)

+ You should now have an unzipped folder containing your html5up theme, inside public_html. Open it and click Select All in the white menu bar to highlight all the files inside.

![Selecting files](/html5up-images/html5up-3.png)

+ Click Move (in the top left-hand corner). A window like this will pop up, allowing you to specify what location you want to move these files to. Unless you want the html5up pages to appear only on a certain subdomain of your site (say, at yoursitename.org/html5uptest/), delete anything that comes after /public_html in the file path. Click Move File(s).

+ Refresh the home page of your site. Your theme should now be visible! If you make any additional changes to your theme, you can either re-upload the individual files you've changed or (if you've changed a lot) go through this process again.
+ Clean up your file manager by deleting the unzipped version of your theme folder and the empty folder where your layout files used to be stored (called html5up-hyperspace in this example).
